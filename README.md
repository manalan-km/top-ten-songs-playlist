# TopTenSongsPlaylist

A really simple web application that runs locally to create a Spotify playlist with your 10 ten listened songs for the past 4 weeks.

Built using:
 - Angular 18: an overkill for a project like this but used for learning purposes.
 - Spotify API: Provides endpoints to access user's listening history and update playlist.
